This git repo is a conversion from the mercurial repo at
https://bitbucket.org/befi/remote-controlled-socket

That repo. had not been updated for 8 years and
[bitbucket may delete it soon](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket).
Hence the fork.

This idea is too good to get lost.
